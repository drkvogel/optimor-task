## Optimor Python Developer Interview Task

I had done this sort of thing before with `BeautifulSoup`, but `Selenium` and `xpath` was new to me.

I have mainly been doing C++ and JavaScript at work recently, so my Python is a bit rusty! And so it took me a bit longer than 1.5hrs.

I found Chrome Dev Tools' "copy Xpath" feature very useful!
